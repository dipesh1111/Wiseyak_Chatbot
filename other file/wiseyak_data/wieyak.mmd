### AI Driven Diagnostics
 
The significance of early diagnosis in solving and evading future health problems is vividly eminent. Healthcare workers have always faced challenges that contribute to losing track of the bigger picture and missing important cues in the data. In cases where traditional measures cannot foresee and confirm an accurate diagnosis, the use of AI in disease diagnostics can uncover these cues and provide suggestions to healthcare professionals in augmenting the decision-making process. AI-Driven Diagnostics are ways to identify patterns in patients medical data via the utilization of AI algorithms. They provide healthcare professionals with insights and information on any patient medical records that could have been easily missed. AI-Driven Diagnostics help ease the diagnostic burden of healthcare workers by providing fast, reliable, and accurate information about patients medical conditions/histories. WiseMD, a collective platform with AI-Driven Diagnostic capabilities for healthcare data, developed by Wiseyak, has been built with first-class support for interoperability and manifold uses, from population health, and clinical trial to the patient registry and specialized EMRs. WiseMD is based on an algorithm that provides health professionals a holistic view, along with AI-driven suggestions, on patient-specific medical history enabling them to make swift and ameliorated decisions personalized specifically for a patient and his/her condition.

### Knowledge Graph
 
Knowledge Graphs have already become an important aspect of our daily lives. From a simple google search to personalized shopping experiences, that include recommendations from online stores or virtual voice assistants (such as Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant), we have been interacting with Knowledge Graphs one way or another. Knowledge Graphs are directed and labeled graphs, incorporated with labels that have well-defined meanings. These represent a compelling abstraction for organizing the world's structured knowledge over the internet and a way to interlink descriptions of entities extracted from multiple data sources. They provide a structure and a common interface for all data and enable the creation of smart multilateral relations throughout the databases. Meaningfully connecting datasets is a powerful strategy for every business, even more so in healthcare as it helps decision-makers and users, and allows computers to gain context within the existing knowledge. Knowledge Graphs have also started to play a central role in machine learning as a method to incorporate world knowledge, as a target knowledge representation for extracted knowledge, and for explaining and illustrating what is learned. How do Knowledge Graphs help? Making Better Decisions by Swift Searches Knowledge Graph gives enriched and in-depth search results, helping to provide relevant facts and contextualized answers to specific questions, rather than a broad search result that usually encompasses many relevant as well as irrelevant documents and messages but no valuable input. Combining Disparate Data Knowledge Graphs help to combine disparate silos of data, giving the user an overview of all knowledge not only within a single department but also across various departments and global organizations.
 
Bringing Together Structured and Unstructured Data Employing a Knowledge Graph technology enables connecting different types of data in meaningful ways and supporting richer data services than most knowledge management systems. Organizations can effortlessly utilize this technology to extract and discover deeper and more subtle patterns with the help of AI and Machine Learning.
 
Future-Proofing Database with Standards With an Enterprise Knowledge Graph(EKG), organizations can benefit from higher reusability of their data while managing data models, as their Knowledge Graphs are compliant with W3C standards.
 
### FHIR
 
Wiseyak Unleashing the Power of AI in Healthcare Products AI Driven Diagnostics Telemedicine Data Analytics aiEMR Disaster Support ePRO Solutions For Hospitals Doctors & Nurses Management Administrative For Patients For Research Organizations For Policy Maker Government International Organizations Resources Knowledge Sharing (NEW) Blogs Wiseyak News Job Vacancy Technologies Knowledge Graph FHIR Medical Imaging NLP Company About Us Team up with Us Wiseyak Team Contact Us FHIR P atient data can be represented in a multitude of ways such as medications, encounters or images via Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Sharing of these data among clinicians or healthcare professionals can be of immense importance in providing proper and improved health care to patients. Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources ( FHIR ) is a standard, created by the Health Level Seven International (HL7) healthcare standards organization, for exchanging healthcare data/ information electronically, providing a means for representing and sharing information among clinicians and organizations in a standard way regardless of how local EHRs represent or store the data. Thus, interoperability of data among different organizations is promoted, thereby making the required medical data readily accessible. FHIR describes data formats and elements pertaining to the EHRs and provides an application programming interface (API) for exchanging EHR s. FHIR combines the best features of previous standards from HL7, like HL7 version 2.x and HL7 version 3.x., into a common specification while being flexible enough to meet needs of a wide variety of use cases within the healthcare ecosystem. With the use of modern web-based suite of API technology, including a HTTP-based RESTful protocol and a choice of JSON, XML or RDF for data representation, FIHR has been faster and easier to implement than ever before. This facilitate s interoperability between legacy healthcare systems, mak ing it easy to provide healthcare information to healthcare providers and individuals on a wide variety of devices from computers to tablets to cell phones, and to allow third-party application developers to develop medical applications that can be easily integrated into existing systems. Why FIHR? There is a tremendous potential in connecting the billions of data points stored in electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical trial records across thousands of medical systems around the country for fostering public health. However, lack of a standardized data sharing system gravely hampers the used of those medical records in discovering n ovel diagnosis and treatment regimens. This is where FIHR comes in: it allows EHRs to "speak" with third-party applications using a common exchange standard to unlock the data stored within them. Benefits of FIHR Provides faster, real-time access to quality data Reduces burden for reporting quality measures Promotes interoperability Reduces effort to implement new measures Improves alignment between eCQMs & clinical decision support WiseMD from WiseYak, is an AI-powered FHIR compatible EMR solution which can be tailored to your organization specific needs. WiseMD is a FHIR compliant platform enabling integration with other FHIR-based applications for capturing, visualizing and analyzing patient medical data. Our embedded dashboards and unified data model make it much easier for clinicians and administrators to track down and understand the cost and quality of medical care specific to each patient. Being a FHIR-based application, WiseMD can scale vertically and horizontally to cost-effectively handle any workload, data or users.
 
### Medical Imaging
 
Medical imaaging refers to the technique s, technologies and process of imaging the interior of a body for clinical analysis and medical intervention, as well as visual representation of organs and tissues, ultimately for diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of medical conditions related to these organs. Medical ImageAnalysis and Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems, in close development with novel imaging techniques, have revolutionized healthcare in recent years. These developments have allowed doctors to achieve a much more accurate diagnosis, at an early stage, of the most important diseases. Technology behind the development of CAD systems stems from various research areas in computer science such as: artificial intelligence, machine learning, pattern recognition, computer vision, image processing and sensors and acquisition. Analysis of medical images from imaging techniques such as MRI, CT-scans, X-rays and so on is quite intricate making it easier to miss important hidden cues in the given data. The use of AI based techniques on these image data can provide insightful information on not only early diagnosis but for treatment of the patient as well. Wiseyak is continuously striving to develop AI based medical image analysis tools for a wide array of use cases on various diseases. While we may still be in early stages, the end goal would be to incorporate these tools into the WiseMD platform in order to create a truly intelligent platform which can aid in diagnostics and treatment through clinical decision support using advanced medical image analysis.
 
### NLP
 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of computational linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence that helps computers analyze, understand, interpret and manipulate human language, in its pursuit to fill the gap between human communication and computer understanding. It was formulated to build software that generates and comprehends natural languages so that a user can have natural conversations with his or her computer instead of through programming or artificial languages like Java or C. Natural language processing strives to build machines that understand and respond to text or voice data and respond with text or speech of their own 2014 in much the same way humans do. IBM The is a computer capable of understanding the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves. Specific tasks for NLP systems may include: Summarizing lengthy blocks of narrative text, such as a clinical note or academic journal article, by identifying key concepts or phrases present in the source material Mapping data elements present in unstructured text to structured fields in an electronic health record in order to improve clinical data integrity Converting data in the other direction from machine-readable formats into natural language for reporting and educational purposes Answering unique free-text queries that require the synthesis of multiple data sources Engaging in optical character recognition to turn images, like PDF documents or scans of care summaries and imaging reports, into text files that can then be parsed and analyzed Conducting speech recognition to allow users to dictate clinical notes or other information that can then be turned into text NLP in Healthcare in the healthcare industry, Natural language processing has many potential applications. NLP can enhance the completeness and accuracy of electronic health records (EHRs) by translating free text into standardized data. It can fill data warehouses and semantic data lakes with meaningful information accessed by free-text query interfaces. It may be able to make documentation requirements easier by allowing providers to dictate their notes or generate tailored educational materials for patients ready for discharge. But perhaps of greatest interest right now, especially to providers in desperate need of point-of-care solutions for incredibly complex patient problems, NLP can be and is being used for clinical decision support. The most famous example of a machine learning NLP in the healthcare industry is IBM Watson, which has dominated headlines due to its growing expertise and applications in clinical decision support (CDS) for precision medicine and cancer care. There is a huge amount of data in the healthcare space and finding the best ways to extract what is relevant and bring it together to help clinicians make the best decisions for their patients is a new challenge that the industry faces. Natural language processing algorithms can be run against these medical data automatically extract features or risk factors. A few of the many examples of NLP in the clinical decision support and risk stratification realms include in 2013, the Department of Veterans Affairs used NLP techniques to review more than 2 billion EHR documents for indications of PTSD, depression, and potential self-harm in veteran patients. The pilot was 80 percent accurate at identifying the difference between records of screenings for suicide and mentions of actual past suicide attempts. Researchers at MIT in 2012 were able to attain a 75 percent accuracy rate for deciphering the semantic meaning of specific clinical terms contained in free-text clinical notes, using a statistical probability model to assess surrounding terms and put ambiguous terms into context. Natural language processing was able to take the speech patterns of schizophrenic patients and identify which were likely to experience an onset of psychosis with 100 percent accuracy. The small proof-of-concept study employed an NLP system with novel combination of semantic coherence and syntactic assays as predictors of psychosis transition. At the University of California Los Angeles, researchers analyzed electronic freewith novellag patients with cirrhosis. By combining natural language processing of radiology reports with ICD-9 codes and lab data, the algorithm attained incredibly high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Researchers from the University of Alabama found that NLP identification of reportable cancer cases was 22.6 percent more accurate and precise than manual review of medical records.The system helped to separate cancer patients whose conditions should be reported to the Cancer Registry Control Panel from cases that did not have to be included in the registry. Natural language processing in healthcare is currently in its initial phases, but its applications are already starting to create ripples in the healthcare sector. Cognitive computing and semantic big data analytics projects, both of which typically rely on NLP for their development, are seeing major investments from some recognizable names. From the most cutting-edge precision medicine applications to the simple task of coding a claim for billing and reimbursement, NLP has nearly limitless potential to turn unstructured data in electronic health from burden to boon. Being a healthcare solutions company, Wiseyak is aware of the potential of NLP in healthcare and is proactively working to develop NLP powered tools to better understand healthcare data. we may still be in early stages of development; the end goal would be to incorporate these tools into the WiseMD platform in order to create a truly intelligent platform which can aid in diagnostics and treatment through clinical decision support.
